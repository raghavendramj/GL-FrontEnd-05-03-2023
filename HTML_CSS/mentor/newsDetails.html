        <h2>Virat Kohli Resigns from Test Match</h2>
        <img src="Images/kohli.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Kohli had stepped down from the Test captaincy role earlier last week
          a day after the Test series ended in Cape Town, marking an end of an
          era in Indian cricket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah opened up about Virat Kohli's decision to
          step down from Test captaincy after India's 2-1 Test series defeat
          against South Africa last week. Revealing that Kohli had talked to the
          team members regarding his decision to step down from the role, Bumrah
          remained tight-lipped on the proceedings, calling it a personal
          decision.

          Kohli had stepped down from the Test captaincy role earlier last week
          a day after the Test series ended in Cape Town, marking an end of an
          era in Indian cricket. Kohli had earlier relinquished his T20I
          captaincy role in November and a month later was removed from ODI
          captaincy position with the selectors naming Rohit Sharma the new
          white-ball captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Virat Kohli told us about leaving his Test captaincy in a team
          meeting. It’s his decision. He knows his body. He knows his frame of
          mind. We respect that. It’s been a pleasure to play under his
          captaincy. I made my debut under him”
        </p>
        <p>
          “He brought in energy. He brought in the fitness culture. He was
          driven. Everybody moved in one direction under his leadership. He has
          been immense and he will still be the immense with his inputs,” said
          Bumrah ahead of the start of the three-match ODI series in Paarl
          against South Africa.

        <h2>India-South Africa Test series involved emotion, Ashes lacked it: Ian Chappell</h2>
        <img src="Images/empure.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Former Australia captain Ian Chappell believes the recently-concluded Test series between South Africa and India showed ample emotion which has been missing from the Ashes. He added that there was some exquisite batting on display in the Test series between South Africa and India despite the conditions being overwhelmingly in favour of the bowling side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some nine hours away South Africa surprisingly defeated India in an old-fashioned dogfight that included some enthralling cricket. It also involved ample emotion of the sort that has notably been missing from an Ashes contest that has been surprisingly uncontroversial so far," wrote Chappell in his column for ESPNCricinfo on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
            South Africa came back from 1-0 down to win the three-match series 2-1 at Cape Town on Friday. Talking further about the batting in particular during the series, Chappell remarked, “The South Africa series featured bowling domination on pitches that were probably too much in favour of the fielding side, but there was also some exquisite batting."
